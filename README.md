# GPU-Based-Tractography-with-Anatomical-Priors
This project implements a **GPU-accelerated tractography method** that leverages **Tract Orientation Maps (TOMs)** as anatomical priors. It re-implements and extends the approach by Gr√ºn et al. by aligning the **dominant fiber direction** to the TOM reference, improving data fidelity and anatomical consistency compared to standard TractSeg.
